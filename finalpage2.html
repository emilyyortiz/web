		<h2> how do these graphs work? </h2>
		<h3> Wrong guesses </h3>
		<p> This first graph has a Y axis labeled “# of games played with # of guesses” that tells the player how many games they played with the number of (wrong) guesses listed on the X axis. Every time that the player plays a round of hangman, new additions to the bar graph are added to reflect the number of their wrong guesses. </p>
		<br>
		<h3> Win lose ratios </h3>
		<p> The second graph, “Win lose ratios!”, has a Y axis named “# of games” and an X axis with labels saying “Win” and “Lose”. Every time that the player finishes a round of hangman, the win or lose bar will increase by one.
			<br>
			<h2> What does this teach us? </h2>
			<p> Shown on this website are 2 versions of the “Wrong guesses” and “Win lose ratios!” graphs. We found that these two sets of graphs show improvement after playing Hangman multiple times. </p>
			<br>
			<h4> Win lose ratios </h4> <img src="https://github.com/annafang30/web/raw/main/graph1+3.png">
			<p> Set one contains graph 1: the result from game 1 and graph 2: the result from game 2. In the first set, the player won 60% of the time, but in the second set, the player won 100% of the time, showing a clear improvement. </p>
			<h4> Wrong guesses </h4> <img src="https://github.com/annafang30/web/raw/main/graph2+4.png">
			<p> As the player familiarizes themselves with playable words, the number of wrong guesses gradually decreases. The player had a decrease of 57.1429% from 7 guesses to 3 guesses, again showing a improvement as the player plays </p>
