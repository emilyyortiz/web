    <p>Jugyeong Lim, played by <a href="https://asianwiki.com/Mun_Ka-Young">Moon Ga-young</a>, loves hanging out at her local comic shop to read horror comics, and she listens to alternate rock too. After being bullied at her old school for being ugly, Jugyeong teaches herself makeup from online tutorials and becomes the pretty girl at her new school, Saebom High School. Jugyeong is popular and makes many friends, but she also struggles to keep her real face and hobbies secret.</p>
