    <p><a href="https://asianwiki.com/Hwang_In-Yeop">Hwang In-yeop</a> plays the cool and dashing Seojun Han, a former idol trainee. He and Suho used to be best friends too, but they had a falling out after Seyeon passed away. Seojun acts tough in front of others, with his group of friends following him around, but on the inside he is sensitive and caring. Seojun is poor, especially compared to Suho, and he works hard to support his mom and sister. Many girls are attracted to Seojun because of his looks, but the only one he cares for is Jugyeong.
