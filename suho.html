    <p>Suho Lee (<a href="https://asianwiki.com/Cha_Eun-Woo">Cha Eun-woo</a>) is very studious and at the top of the class. Suho is rich too, because his dad is a famous actor. It is rumored that he used to be friendly, but after the death of his best friend Seyeon Yoon, Suho has become cold and expressionless. He only talks when necessary and isolates himself, refusing to make friends. However, after meeting Jugyeong, Suho opens up a little bit and shows his softer side. They both like reading horror comics!</p>
